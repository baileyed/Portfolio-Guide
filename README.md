# Data Processing

| Project Link | Language | Project Description | Libraries |
|---|---|---|---|
| [PIOMAS Processing](https://github.com/baileyed/piomas) | Python | Script that is used to read raw binary PIOMAS datasets, apply a rotation matrix, and write the data into a usable nc file. | Libraries |

# Data Analysis and Visualization

| Project Link | Language | Project Description | Libraries |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Time series Analysis](https://github.com/baileyed/timeseries-analysis) | R | This is a repository of my work for a graduate course in time series analysis with applications using seismological, paleoclimate, and historical climate data | N/A |
